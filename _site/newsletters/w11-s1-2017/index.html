<meta name="description" content="It’s Flashback Thursday! With the Sydney Vivid festival coming up, we’re taking a look back at our previous installations. We cannot wait to unveil what we have for Vivid 2017 - it is bigger, brighter and cannot be missed. Stay tuned for more. Vivid 2016 - Mondrian cube. Set up in Circular Quay, CREATE learned that if you make something interative, kids will kick it. We love that the cube was a big hit with everyone. Vivid 2015 - Giant robotic Pacman. Technology may get better but Pacman never gets old. Who doesn’t want to see giant ghosts hunting down a smiley yellow pie? HACKERSPACE: MONDAY (22 May) 6-8PM Tyree G16 - OpenCV + Raspberry Pi This is Part 2 of our OpenCV workshop, run in conjunction with CSEsoc! The content we will be covering includes binary masks, colour tracking and feature and object detection. Come along to Tyree G16 and get started on some of the amazing things you can do with computer-based vision systems. Assumed knowledge: C++ (basic understanding sufficient). C knowledge alone will mean that you may understand most of the code but could have trouble following along. If you have never done any programming before at all, this workshop is probably not for you. What to bring: Raspberry Pi + PiCamera Kits will be on sale at the workshop so that you may build your own image processing programs. For those with Raspberry Pis, please install Opencv3 prior to the workshop from this link. Hungry? Free pizza afterwards! Still can’t attend? We have a Youtube live stream and the recording will be available afterwards. RECRUITING - UAS CREATE Unmanned Aerial Systems wants Compsci students with experience in ROS, C++ and image recognition to build planes! Email us at uas@createunsw.com.au. QUAD KITS FOR SALE Our quad kits are now available! These are perfect for surveying, aerial mapping or photography. Our kits come with everything you will need to build and fly it. Come check them out at our stall! Go anywhere you want in the world with one of our quad kits. Take stunning aerial footage and sights that are impossible to see in person. Our kit comes with everything you need to make it fly. Have a chat to us at our Monday 12-4pm stall at Globe Lawn or visit our online store." />
