<meta name="description" content="This week we are continuing the Hackerspace workshops with Part 2 of Electronics! Thanks to those who came to Part 1 last week, if you missed it or want to rewatch, you can find the video recording here. HACKERSPACE W4 MONDAY (20th March) 6-8PM MCIC Ground Floor - ELECTRONICS - Solder a light display Come down to Michael Crouch Innovation Centre on the ground floor of the Material Science building for Part 2 of the Electronics workshop with CREATE! This week we’re continuing with working on electronics and learning how to solder, and how it is useful in circuit design. If you missed the first part or you’re a complete beginner, you can still buy the kit and follow along while making your own interactive lighting circuit. Kits are $10 and are available at the workshop or on our Monday sales stall. The workshop is FREE along with the PIZZA after, so come along, learn a cool new skill, make some new friends with the same interests all while getting fed for the night! If you can’t make it to the workshop, watch our live stream here on YouTube. Join us on the Facebook event. SALES STALL W4 Mon 20 March 12-4pm - Globe Lawn Take your selfies to a whole new level with our quadcopters, now selling on CREATE’s website and sales stall! We’re on every Monday at Globe Lawn and everything we sell is on our online store. If you can’t make it, you can buy online and send us an email to arrange a pickup time. This photo above of Where’s Wally revellers in Cyprus was one of the winners in the 2015 International Drone Photography Contest. Scroll down for some more stunning aerial pictures you could take. We wish we were still on holidays! RECRUITING - UAS CREATE Unmanned Aerial Systems is looking for new members, especially Compsci students, that have experience in ROS, C++ and image recognition. You will gain extensive experience in the Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle industry and have lots of chances to test your own ideas. Email uas@createunsw.com.au if intereted. Want to build your own self driving car? CREATE is looking for new people to join one of our 5 established teams, or to make their own teams, to do just that. Whether you want to do this as a learning experience just for fun, or whether you’re taking yourselves seriously enough to try to become one of the two teams that we send up to a competition in Queensland this year, you should totally come along to our getting-started-again meeting this Monday, 6pm in the MCIC. Special shoutout to anyone who wants to get their hands dirty with OpenCV image processing software, as most teams presently lack a dedicated software person." />
