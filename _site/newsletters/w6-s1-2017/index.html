<meta name="description" content="Our THIRD AND FINAL Arduino workshop is on Monday! As usual our sales stall will be at Globe Lawn on Monday 12 - 4pm or in front of MCIC if it’s raining! Check out our online store. HACKERSPACE: MONDAY (10 April) 6-8PM MCIC Ground Floor - ARDUINO PART 3 What’s an arduino? A low-cost, open-source microcontroller. It provides an easy way to interface sensors that interact with the external environment to the electrical hardware you wish to control. Do I need equipment? We suggest buying a kit if you don’t have one from the previous weeks. There are two options: the basic $20 kit or a comprehensive kit with the option of either an UNO or MEGA. They have a fantastic variety of components as well as all of the necessities. See here for more info. They are available at the Monday sales stall or at the workshop. What else to bring? Your laptop! The workshop software is free and easy to install, best to do this before the workshop so we can get right to the fun stuff. The current Arduino IDE: Arduino software Some libraries to operate parts that come with the kits: Library. Complete beginner? Not a problem, we teach you everything! Hungry? Free pizza afterwards! Still can’t attend? We have a Youtube live stream and the recording will be available afterwards. RECRUITING - UAS CREATE Unmanned Aerial Systems wants Compsci students with experience in ROS, C++ and image recognition to build planes! Email us at uas@createunsw.com.au. QUAD KITS FOR SALE Our quad kits are now available! These are perfect for surveying, aerial mapping or photography. Our kits come with everything you will need to build and fly it. Come check them out at our stall! UNSW ASPIRE Job Opp ASPIRE is seeking student assistants to work with ASPIRE staff to develop and trial educational resources focused on introducing coding and computational thinking for students in years 4-8 (ages 9-14). This will involve the use of Raspberry Pi’s, Makey-Makey’s and Sphero robots to create fun activities that can be used in schools. The role will involve some basic knowledge of coding and above average skills in using digital technologies. The rate of pay is $31.60 per hour and you will be required to work on campus alongside team members for approximately 3 hours per week. The project will involve up to 20 hours in total.
